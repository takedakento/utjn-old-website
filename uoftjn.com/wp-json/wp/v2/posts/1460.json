Joe was one of two kids of Asian descent in his grade and he remembers being teased by his white classmates and feeling like an \u201coutsider\u201d. The racialization he faced as a visible minority occurred on a daily basis. Being one of the very few kids of Asian descent in school, his \u201cAsian\u201d ethnicity came to represent those very broad conceptions of what it was to be an Asian. He was \u201cthe Asian kid\u201d at school that people knew about, resulting in tokenism of his identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, even superficial acceptances and friendships based on forms of misrecognition with his classmates was more important to him than standing up for himself. Having experienced overt racism through his daily interactions, and wishing to be accepted, Joe remembers playing into his classmates\u2019 racist \u201cjokes\u201d about his \u201cAsian\u201d appearance and culture (for example, \u201cjokes\u201d on his relatively thinner eyes). Ultimately, he became \u201cwhitewashed\u201d to adapt and navigate through the dominant culture at school. Regardless of his efforts to fit in, Joe struggled with accepting his racial difference. He recalls feeling alienated and even regretful and ashamed about being Filipino.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>&lt;English as Survival Mechanism&gt;<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0px;\">Joe\u2019s parents were also aware of the consequences of being a visible minority in their community and took sophisticated approaches to prevent further racism and racial misrecognition of Joe and his two sisters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite Tagalog being their mother tongue, Joe\u2019s parents preferred to use English at home with the family. According to Joe, his parents believed that learning Tagalog would result in funny accents in Joe\u2019s and his sisters\u2019 English and considered it to be a source of difference or discrimination from their white peers. Thus, Joe grew up speaking English to his siblings and parents, and \u201cTaglish,\u201d which is a mix of English and Tagalog. Speaking English at home reflected his parents\u2019 efforts to prevent further racism of Joe and his two sisters and to blend in with the community in which they lived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting on the language preference in his household, Joe does not regret nor resent the approach that his parents pursued. However, Joe now wishes he could communicate more in Tagalog, given his new life in Vietnam as a high school teacher at an international school, where some of the students are Filipino.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>&lt;\u201cBut I am Canadian.\u201d&gt;<br \/>\n<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe received his Bachelor degree in Communications, English and Professional Writing from the University of Toronto Mississauga campus, as well as a degree in Bachelor of Education from Ontario Institute of Studies in Education (OISE). \u00a0Becoming a teacher was always his dream, and after completing his second degree, Joe began his career as a teacher in the Toronto District School Board. After marrying my oldest sister in July 2016, Joe decided to continue his career abroad and moved to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam by himself. The life that awaited him in Vietnam was way more different than what he had expected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Vietnam, Joe also faces the reality of his \u2018in-betweenness\u2019 or his mixed identity as a Canadian of Filipino descent. Canadian people are usually imagined as white, European looking individuals in Vietnam. This racialized geographical imagination of Canada situates Joe in an ambiguous \u2018in-between\u2019 category of people. The identity as Canadian that Joe has struggled to navigate and embraced all his life was all of a sudden being questioned in a foreign land.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe often experiences the exoticization of his nationality, ethnicity, and identity in Vietnam, a familiar circumstance that he experienced in his community back in Brampton, Ontario. The sense of alienation and negotiation of his identity is a continuing process even in a different landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d is a common question that Joe gets. Vietnamese people are often confused by his introduction as a Canadian person when he visibly does not look like a Caucasian foreign, but rather more like themselves. With the combination of his unaccented native English, Vietnamese people are even more perplexed by this Vietnamese-looking, but Canadian persona. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1463\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/uoftjn.com\/2018\/02\/10\/hyphenated-negotiating-identities-as-an-asian-canadian\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?fit=782%2C959&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"782,959\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?fit=245%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?fit=750%2C920&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1463 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?resize=245%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?resize=245%2C300&amp;ssl=1 245w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?resize=768%2C942&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/27939255_10216285608839708_1766618447_n.jpg?w=782&amp;ssl=1 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><em>Joe on his motorbike, in a busy street in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recognition and acceptance of Joe as Canadian in Vietnam seems to be contingent on him also identifying himself as Filipino.

While Joe\u2019s hyphenated identity may play an important role in Vietnam in defying and challenging the hegemonic discourse of what Canadians look like, this hyphenation also produces differences between his \u201cidentity\u201d and \u201cidentification.\u201d <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNo matter the location, I am Canadian. Home is always Canada,\u201d <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says Joe, clearly identifying himself as Canadian, without adding the hyphenated ethnicity. On the other hand, when in Vietnam, the hegemonic imagination of Canada and \u201cCanadians\u201d as predominantly being Western Europeans, especially, British and French, the hyphenated Canadians become situated at the periphery within the framework of \u201cCanadian.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout his life, in both Brampton and Ho Chi Minh City Joe faced overt forms of local racisms. \u00a0He was forced to constantly learn how to navigate his racialized environment and present his racialized identity in sophisticated ways. In Canada, he played along with the racist jokes in grade school and spoke English with no accent in order to mitigate racial misrecognition and racism. In Vietnam, Joe also utilizes the English language as a tool and coping mechanism to reduce racism, and to shift the local racial misunderstanding of him in Ho Chi Minh City.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe\u2019s experiences in in Canada and Vietnam, has challenged and helped him develop his cultural and racial elasticity through the constant navigation, negotiation and presentation of his identity in different locations.
