If you are asked to list some things you can do to mitigate climate change, you can probably list things like recycling, turning lights off, using transportation, etc. But if you are asked whether you actually do those things every day, your answer would probably be \u201cno.\u201d Why is this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International community too \u2013 it\u2019s scientifically recognized that we need to reduce carbon emission and keep the temperature increase below 2 degree Celsius. But there\u2019s no practical plan for carbon reduction. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, each nation submitted its own action plan of reducing carbon emission, as opposed to creating a collective international plan. Meanwhile, the temperature keeps rising. 2017 was the second hottest year since 1880!

At the individual level, there are structural barriers like lack of infrastructure and psychological factors like judgmental discounting, system justification, and fatalism\u2026 (Gifford, 2011) A lot of research has been done and you can check each of these if you want to; but here I want to focus on one of the main factors of inactions that can be applied at both individual and international levels: <\/span><b>collective action problem<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The famous concept \u201cthe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d (Hardin, 1968) is the application of collective action problem to resource extraction. It indicates that individuals, based on their \u201crational\u201d self-interest to maximize their own profit, exploit resources, which results in a negative outcome as a whole of resource depletion and environmental destruction. You want to benefit as much as you want, and you don\u2019t want to engage in cost-incurring actions such as reducing your extractions for the resource sustainability since it means you let others free-ride, that is, continue to profit from their resource extraction without paying costs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So&#8230; people are not as rational as they are thought to be, in the long-term. With our brain being adjusted to the pre-industrial\/agricultural period in which humans were concerned with immediate dangers and survival, we are not accustomed to think about long-term collective consequences (Gifford, 2011). We know what\u2019s going to happen in the long run i.e. environmental crisis and possibly extinction of humanity, but we don\u2019t change our behavior.<br \/>\nIn a sense, individuals are rational because people know they would be already dead when human extinction happens \u2013 whatever one does to environment doesn\u2019t directly lead to any negative effect to oneself; but humans have capacity to feel and think about our children and our grandchildren. I would say many people do care more about their own children and grandchildren than themselves, and I therefore think it\u2019s irrational that individuals do things that harm future generations. If we are rational we would have already started reducing carbon emission dramatically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1426\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/uoftjn.com\/2018\/02\/01\/climate-change\/kyoko2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?fit=775%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"775,499\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"kyoko2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?fit=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?fit=750%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1426\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?resize=320%2C206&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?resize=770%2C499&amp;ssl=1 770w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/uoftjn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/kyoko2.png?w=775&amp;ssl=1 775w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collective action problem, in the case of inactions toward climate change, essentially comes to this: people don\u2019t want to take action with high cost if others are not doing the same. You don\u2019t want to turn off the heater and save energy if others are not doing the same because you would be just sacrificing your comfort while others are enjoying it. Similarly, <em>the U.S. don\u2019t want to reduce their carbon emission because developing countries like China and India aren\u2019t stopping their emissions. <\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar things happen everywhere to anyone &#8211; I live in a condo, and my floor has a tiny room with a garbage chute. That garbage chute often goes \u201cout of service\u201d so you would have to carry the garbage bags back to your place and come again at another time. Some people leave the garbage bags on the floor because they don\u2019t want to waste their time and energy carrying the garbage bags back.<br \/>\nResult: the room with garbage chute disgustingly filled with garbage bags left on the floor.<br \/>\nIf others are leaving their garbage bags there anyway, you wouldn\u2019t carry your garbage bags back, let alone clean up the garbage bags of someone\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what do you have to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cooperation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I know, this is a broad abstract concept that we have heard ever since we were little kids; but that is what we need to do. Ultimately, you have to cooperate with everyone else, stop leaving the garbage on the floor, and bear some costs for what you are doing to keep the environment healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This simple thing called cooperation is apparently very difficult to do in a global scale; but this is something we can\u2019t avoid if we want to live in a sustainable environment. And I am optimistic about this. Historically, people have tackled with and avoided many possible disasters such as nuclear war (for now). When it comes to the times in which the existence of humanity is threatened, people do act. Today, we are seeing less and less blue skies, more fogs, more hurricanes and extreme weathers. I believe now is the time, and I hope our generation is the one that starts this. Someone has to stop leaving the garbage bags on the floor so that it spreads to the community, and that it becomes norm for the benefit of all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citation:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gifford, R.
