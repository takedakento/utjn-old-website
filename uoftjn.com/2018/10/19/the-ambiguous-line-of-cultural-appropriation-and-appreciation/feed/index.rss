Thank you Nori for your comment ! :) I think there definitely is a lack of knowledge amongst Japanese people what &#039;cultural appropriation&#039; even means and they are unable to make the distinction and thus would associate anything to &#039;appreciation&#039;. (and vise versa with the West being overly sensitive about the issue at times and any cultural representations are &#039;appropriation&#039;). I would definitely also want to see 日本人海外大生 &#039;s opinions since they are exposed to both cultures!]]></description>

Hey, its Nanami thanks for your input :) ! I completely agree with you that the reactions could have differed if it had been a model from another race, thats a very good point. (not to mention the bad blood between Japanese and Koreans from the past)  Japanese people could possibly react differently because we expect those who are Asians to understand our culture more-so than someone who is Caucasian simply because we understand the great distinction of different Asian cultures (to Americans, Korean and Japanese culture may be somewhat similar but we would argue otherwise) and thus I would say that this could be one of the reasons Karlie Kloss got the hall pass because we do not expect Caucasians to understand our culture in great detail. Obviously theres a lot more factors that come into play but I think inherently there definitely is a over appreciation or lack of a better term, great fascination towards white culture by Japanese people because it is so foreign to them the same way White people see Japanese culture as being exotic and different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cultural appropriation and appreciation is a difficult topic to talk about, and I think Naomi did a great job explaining it with the example. I think it is one of those issues that every individual has to reconsider before posting such criticisms.

But one thing I want to point out is that the reaction (in this case appreciation) from the Japanese could have been different, if the magazine used a different model. 
May be rude, but while 
Karlie Kloss is: a Victoria Secret model, who has a celebrity status, white, pretty, and her photo is for an American magazine (whose subscribers are mostly white).
the reaction from the Japanese (mostly ネット民)could have been different (now it is cultural appropriation), if the
model is: a South Korean, not that pretty (or had a plastic surgery), and her photo is for a South Korean magazine. 
For the latter case, I think some Japanese will be &quot;appropriating&quot; the model, while in other countries, people will be &quot;appreciating&quot; or simply ignoring the Japanese criticism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Quite interesting article :) 

Nanami touches on one interesting aspect of &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; which is how the people in the West overly associate race/ethnicity as the component of the culture whereas it seems that we Japanese are not even aware that a lack of &quot;right&quot; ethnicity in the culture can lead to the cultural appropriation. I think the reason for such difference in the perceptions between the West and Japan is up to another discussion, but I would be interested to know how 日本人海外大生 (Japanese who were exposed to the Western culture) would feel about these photoshoots!]]></description>
